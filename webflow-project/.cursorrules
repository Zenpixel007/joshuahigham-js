# Cursor Rules File for Webflow JavaScript Project
# This file provides guidelines to ensure that AI-generated code aligns with project standards.

[General]
# The project is a Webflow custom code integration.
# Use modern JavaScript (ES6+), maintain readability, and include clear comments.
project_type = "Webflow Custom Code"
language = "JavaScript"
style = "ES6, modular, and well-commented"

[Libraries]
# GSAP for animations and Barba.js for page transitions.
# Ensure usage follows best practices.
libraries = "GSAP, Barba.js"

[GSAP]
# When generating code involving animations:
# - Use GSAP's timeline where possible.
# - Optimize for performance and smooth transitions.
default_timeline = true
use_plugins = "ScrollTrigger if needed"

[BarbaJS]
# When dealing with page transitions:
# - Utilize Barba.js's lifecycle hooks.
# - Ensure transitions are smooth and transitions are easily maintained.
transition_logic = "modular and easy to extend"

[CodeQuality]
# All code should:
# - Use clear, consistent naming conventions.
# - Include inline comments explaining complex logic.
# - Be structured in a modular fashion for reusability.
naming_convention = "camelCase for variables and functions"
comments = "extensive and clear"
error_handling = "include basic error handling where applicable"

[Deployment]
# The code is eventually deployed as custom code on a Webflow project.
# Ensure that relative paths are correctly referenced.
deployment = "Webflow Embed/Custom Code"

[Integration]
# Code should be easy to integrate with Netlify continuous deployment.
# When generating code, assume that it might be part of a larger Git-based workflow.
